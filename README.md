### Customizing Quotes with AI
Want to personalize your inspirational quotes? You can easily generate custom quotes using AI tools!

1. **Generate Quotes with AI**:
   - Use ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any AI assistant

   - Or get themed quotes: *"Create 30 quotes about coding and technology"*
   - Request specific styles: *"Generate motivational quotes in the style of Stoic philosophy"*

2. **Format Your Quotes**:
   - AI will generate quotes in this format:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "text": "Your custom quote here",
       "author": "Author Name"
     },
     {
       "text": "Another inspiring quote",
       "author": "Another Author"
     }
   ]
   ```

3. **Add to Extension**:
   - Open `quotes.json` in the extension folder
   - Replace existing quotes or add your new ones
   - Keep the same JSON structure (array of objects with "text" and "author")
   - Save the file

4. **Reload Extension**:
   - Go to `edge://extensions/` or `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click reload button on the extension
   - Open new tab to see your custom quotes!
